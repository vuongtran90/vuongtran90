### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vuong Tran, front-end developer based in Bangkok, with over 8 years of experience in crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences, currently working at [AnyMind Group](https://anymindgroup.com/).

I work mainly with web technologies such as Javascript, Typescript, React, Angular, Nextjs and Tailwind, and I occasionally dabble in Svelte.
