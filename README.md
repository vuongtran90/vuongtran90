### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vuong Tran, front-End developer currently living in Bangkok, with over 8 years of experience in crafting engaging and user-friendly web experiences.

I've spent more than 6 years of my career as a front-end developer at [AnyMind Group](https://anymindgroup.com/).

My journey began with 2 formative years in Vietnam as a front-end developer, where my passion for web development ignited.

I work mainly with web technologies such as Javascript, Typescript, React, Angular, Nextjs and Tailwind, and I occasionally dabble in Svelte.

More about me on [my site](http://vuongtran.co/), and you can also reach me via email at [hello@vuongtran.co](mailto:hello@vuongtran.co)
